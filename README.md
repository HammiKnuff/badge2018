# Bornhack Badge 2018 - Breakout boards

This branch of the Bornhack 2018 badge repo is for all the breakout boards,
that you can add onto the badge, to give extra functionality or simply
expore some interesting electronic components and PCB features.

These boards have been designed, as a starting point for tinkering a bit
with electronics in relation to the badge and the microcontrollers that
are on there.

Some of these breakout boards are very simple and beginner friendly, and
can be used as a simple soldering excercise, others use smaller and smaller
components, so that more experienced hackers will also have a little bit of
a challenge.

The badge team will have a few components (a little bit more when it comes
to blink LEDs and header pins), but these boards will come without components
and be distributed at random with the badges.

If you want to hack on a specific one, you can trade with the others or stop
by the badge team and we will have some extra boards.

You can ofcourse also modify and make your own based on these designs, that
would be awesome.

As it is right now, these boards are NOT tested, so consider them experimental.
